    "- During the whole lifetime of an object, object undergoes a lot of events like :\n",

    "    - deletion(last event of life of an object)\n",
    "    - adding two objects\n",

    "- Python have special functions known as **magic functions or dunders** which handdles all these events. These **dunders are defined by two underscore at begining and end  of the method name. These magic functions have some special meaning.**"

    "##### 1. \\__init__(self, arg1,arg2,arg3, ...) :\n",
    "- \\__init__ method is called when an object is created.\n",
    "##### 2. \\__del__(self) \n",
    "- \\__del__ method is called when an object is destroyed.(it is different from destructor.)\n",
    "##### 3. \\__add__(self, other)\n",
    "- \\__add__ method is called when we add 2 objects: O1+O2 => It calls method as O1.\\__add__(O2). We have defined 2 arguments in \\__add__ where self is O1 and other is O2. Where the other object(as O2 here) can be of any class(same or other class).\n",
    "##### 4. \\__str__(self)\n",
    "- \\__str__ method is called, when we convert an object into list. eg- a=45 , str(a)\n",
    "##### 5. \\__eq__(self,other)\n",
    "- It is called when we maade comparison between objects: eg- O1==O2. It calls method as : O1.\\__eq__(O2)\n",
    "##### There are a lot of dunders in python whose list can be searched from google.\n",
    "#### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "### Use of Dunders:\n",
    "- Unlike C++, python do not have the concept of operator overloading. **These magic functions are used to define overloaded behaviour of operators.**  \n",
    "- We can do this by overriding magic functions: we can redefine these dunders and define them accordingly to define new behaviour of overloaded operators."
